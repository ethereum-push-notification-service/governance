# Governance Process 

## 1. Proposal Phase - gov.epns.io

This is the very start of the entire governance journey. For any proposal to be accepted and executed for EPNS Governance. The proposer needs to submit their draft proposal over at Governance Proposal section with the rules mentioned below.

>Note: This is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before participating. Proposals on the forum must be submitted following a template.

### How to submit a Draft Proposals

Users needs to follow this template and post a new proposal draft under Governance Proposals.
Champions then checks the submitted draft proposals to ensure it follows the governance rules, some proposals will be asked resubmission based on champions discretion during enforcement of the rules.
Draft proposals may then being promoted to the Governance Discussions section provided they meet the promotion criteria mentioned below.

### Promotion Criteria

Champions will move the proposal from the Governance Proposals section to the Governance Discussion section if they meet the following criteria:

- Must have 5 Likes (minimum)

>Note: The rules of governance (meta-governance) is also the subject of governance and thus can be changed following the due process. The git repo and the forum will always reflect the latest rules as enforced and governed by the $PUSH token holders.

## 2. Discussion Phase - [gov.epns.io](gov.epns.io)
The next step in the governance journey is discussion. Draft proposals from Proposal phase that meet the promotion criteria are promoted to Governance Discussions section by a PUSH Champion.
Draft proposals in this phase are considered to be serious enough to initiate discussion on them. We expect and encourage community to debate about them or like them if the thoughts align.

### How to submit a Draft Proposal for Discussion

- Only Champions can push draft proposals once they have met the criteria to Governance Discussion.
- This section is intended to serve as the last step before submitting a proposal to Snapshot.
- Proposals can be pushed through to this section once enough traction has been gained in the Governance Proposals section.
- From here, draft proposals becomes a formal proposal once promotion criteria is met and will subsequently be pushed to Snapshot for voting to commence.
- Only users who have $75k votes (delegated or owned) can initiate the formal proposal. If the user doesn't have enough votes, then it's expected of the user to either find a Delegatee to submit their formal proposal or request a Champion to find one for them.

### Promotion Criteria
A draft proposal becomes a formal proposal if the following criteria are met:
- Must be live for 5+ days in the Governance Discussion category
- Must have a minimum of 10 likes
- Must have a minimum of 3 replies

>Note: The draft proposal promoted by Push Champions can deviate a bit from what started in the Governance Proposal section owing to the discussion and the sprit of the proposal. In the event of discrepancy between draft proposal submitted in the Governance Proposal section and the Governance Discussion section. The proposal under Governance Discussion section will prevail.

## 3. Governance Phase - Snapshot

Once the proposal on the Governance Discussion section meets the promotion  criteria, It's considered a formal proposal and requires formal voting which takes place on Snapshot. A formal proposal can be defeated or accepted as outlined by the rules below.

Votes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of $PUSH delegated to the address used to vote. A minimum of 75,000 $PUSH tokens are required to create a proposal.

>Note: Only users who have $75k votes (delegated) can initiate the formal proposal. If the user doesn't have enough votes, then it's expected of the user to either find a Delegatee to submit their formal proposal or request a Champion to find one for them.

### How to submit a Formal Proposal on Snapshot

The draft proposal that passes the promotion criteria of Discussion phase are termed as formal proposal as they would be sent for formal voting. The rules for submission of a formal proposal on snapshot are as follows:

- Formal proposals needs to be submitted to Snapshot.
- PUSH Champions will be moderating the proposals on Snapshot by the rules mentioned here.
- Only the users or a Push Delegatee can submit the proposals on the snapshot.
- All proposals on Snapshot must be given at least 7 days for the community to vote on the proposal.

### Promotion Criteria
- The proposal needs to meet the Quorum for it to be considered valid. Quorum is defined as 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH voting in the affirmative.
- If the Quorum is not achieved in 7 days for a proposal, then the proposal is considered as defeated.

## What is Quorum

For a vote to pass on Snapshot, it must achieve a quorum of 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH voting in the affirmative. The purpose of the quorum is to ensure that, the proposals that are approved have adequate voter participation. This means that if a proposal that had a majority of votes affirmative but didn't achieve the necessary quorum, it won't be approved.
