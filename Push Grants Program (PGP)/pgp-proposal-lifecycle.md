# PGP Proposal Lifecycle 

## 1. Proposal Phase

This is the very start of the PGP proposal journey. For any grant proposal to be accepted and executed, the proposer needs to submit their grant proposal under the Push Grants Program (PGP) section with the rules mentioned below.

>Note: This is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before participating. Proposals on the forum must be submitted following a template.

### How to submit a Grant Proposal

Users needs to follow this template and post a new proposal draft under Push Grants Program (PGP) section.
Champions then check the submitted draft proposal to ensure it follows the PGP rules, some proposals will be asked resubmission based on champions discretion during enforcement of the rules.
Draft proposals may then be promoted to Poll Phase provided they meet the promotion criteria mentioned below.

### Promotion Criteria

Champions will start a Poll for the grant proposal if they meet the following criteria:

- Must follow the [Draft Proposal Template](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/governance/blob/main/draft-proposal-template.md)
- Must be submitted under Push Grants Program (PGP) section
- Must be live for 7+ days
- Must have a minimum of 10 likes
- Must have a minimum of 3 replies (in favor)

>Note: The rules of PGP is also the subject of governance and thus can be changed following the due process. The git repo and the forum will always reflect the latest rules as enforced and governed by the $PUSH token holders.

## 2. Poll Phase 
The next step in the PGP journey is Poll. A PUSH Champion will create Poll for each Grant proposal that meet the promotion criteria.
The idea of this phase is to get a temperature check from the community post all the discussions & revisions made in the proposal before promoting to formal voting.

### How to create a Poll for the grant proposal

- Only Champions can create a Poll once the grant proposal have met the criteria.
- The Poll is intended to serve as the last step before submitting a proposal to Snapshot.

### Promotion Criteria
- Must get atleast 10 votes in total
- Will be moved along with For/Against majority
- FOR: Proposal gets advanced to Snapshot within 3 days
- AGAINST: Proposers are notified and encouraged to reapply after digesting feedback received.

## 3. Governance Phase - Snapshot

Once the proposal passes the Poll, it requires formal voting which takes place on Snapshot. A formal proposal can be defeated or accepted as outlined by the rules below.

Votes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of $PUSH delegated to the address used to vote. A minimum of 75,000 $PUSH tokens are required to create a proposal.

>Note: Only users who have $75k votes (delegated) can initiate the formal proposal. If the user doesn't have enough votes, then it is expected of the user to either find a Delegatee to submit their formal proposal or request a Champion to find one for them.

### How to submit a Grant Proposal on Snapshot

The rules for submission of a grant proposal on snapshot are as follows:

- Grant proposals needs to be submitted to Snapshot.
- PUSH Champions will be moderating the proposals on Snapshot by the rules mentioned here.
- Only a Push Delegatee (users with 75k PUSH votes delegated) can submit proposals on the Snapshot.
- All proposals on Snapshot must be given at least 7 days for the community to vote on the proposal.

### Promotion Criteria
- The proposal needs to meet the Quorum for it to be considered valid. Quorum is defined as 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH voting in the affirmative.
- If the Quorum is not achieved in 7 days for a proposal, then the proposal is considered as defeated.

## What is Quorum

For a vote to pass on Snapshot, it must achieve a quorum of 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH voting in the affirmative. The purpose of the quorum is to ensure that, the proposals that are approved have adequate voter participation. This means that if a proposal that had a majority of votes affirmative but didn't achieve the necessary quorum, it won't be approved.
