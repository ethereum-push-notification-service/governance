# Reimburse your channel creation gas fees in $PUSH

The community had recently voted on and passed [PIP-06: Reimburse channel-creation gas fees in $PUSH on developer request](https://snapshot.org/#/epns.eth/proposal/0x1fd82313d4356e5d7963c60649f0376e995cf326ff348269293026e6064e1f38). The results were immensely in favor of the proposal with 1.6M votes FOR and 2.6K votes AGAINST.

You can now request reimbursement of 80% of your gas fee within 24 hours of the channel creation, and your Gas fee will be reimbursed into your wallet in the form of $PUSH tokens. This removes an obstruction for underfunded or hobbyist developers from opening a notification channel.

## How to get the reimbursement?

- Dev creates a channel
- Announces the channel creation on the EPNS discord (use of multiple emojis preferred ðŸ˜Š )
- Let the world know of your channel and tag EPNS on all of your socials when you post(preferably Twitter).
- Dev shares relevant details in this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNQ2_mACRQgyIPsr47woE69_FOds8aLIGupT20QIEUMfgnQw/viewform)

The EPNS team will review the form and send devs $PUSH relative to the market price. Note that the request must be sent within 24 hours of channel creation. This proposal is funded through Push Governance and was voted on in snapshot.
