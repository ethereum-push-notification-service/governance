## A Proposal Draft is created on Governance Proposals
When a proposal draft is created in the Governance Proposal, the following can happen:

1. The proposal draft is created without following the guidelines (for example without being clear what the proposal is for)
2. The proposal draft does not get enough traction in 30 days
3. It is a duplicate proposal
4. The proposal draft is valid and meets the necessary criteria
5. The proposal draft is for a feature that won’t be able to be changed in this first governance iteration
6. The user has already a proposal draft on the Governance Proposals in the last 7 days
7. Inappropriate content porn, obscene, or not related to the EPNS ecosystem

### 1 - The proposal draft is created without following the guidelines (for example without being clear what the proposal is for)

In this scenario, a PUSH Champion will comment on the proposal draft saying that it does not follow the guidelines and will block other people from commenting on the proposal draft. First close immediately the proposal then Archive after 7 days. Add a link to the guideline post.

### 2 - The proposal draft does not get enough traction in 30 days

If the proposal draft is created correctly but it didn’t get enough traction a PUSH Champion will close it and comment on the proposal draft saying it didn’t meet the criteria. When closing the proposal draft add a link to the post with the guidelines explaining the reason it was archived.

### 3 - It is a duplicate proposal

A PUSH Champion will comment on the proposal saying that it’s a copy of an existing proposal and will close the proposal. Add a link to the original proposal.

### 4 - The proposal draft is valid and meets the necessary criteria

If the proposal draft meets the criteria, a PUSH Champion will:

- Create a proposal draft on the Governance Discussion
- Comment on the existing proposal draft adding a reference to the new proposal draft created on Governance Discussion
- Close the proposal draft in order to be still visible on the forum.

Promoting an idea to Governance Discussions checklist:

- Must have a proper title to reveal the core idea
- Must have a clearly understandable summary
- Must be live for 5+ days in the Lobby category
- Must have 5 Likes (minimum)
- Follow template

If all the conditions above are met, a PUSH Champion can move the proposal draft to the Governance Discussions.

Fill a Google Form in order to avoid proposal drafts duplication. PUSH Champions will be responsible for filling this form after creating the proposal draft on governance discussion.

### 5 - The proposal draft is for a feature that won’t be able to be changed in the governance in this first iteration

In this case, a PUSH Champion will comment on the proposal draft saying that for this first governance iteration this won’t be allowed for voting and close the proposal draft. Add the current categories that are open.

### 6 - The user has already a proposal draft on the Governance Proposal in the last 7 days

A PUSH Champion will archive the proposal draft with a message saying that the user has already made a proposal draft in the last 7 days, close it, archive after 7 days and invite the user to remake the proposal draft after 7 days.

### 7 - Inappropriate content porn, obscene, or not related to the EPNS ecosystem

The proposal draft will be deleted and the user will be muted/banned.

## Proposal draft is moved from the Governance Proposals to Governance Discussion

A proposal draft on Governance Discussion must meet the criteria within 30 days. If not, a PUSH Champion will close the proposal draft.

Whenever a proposal draft is moved to the Governance Discussion, a PUSH Champion will make a comment on the proposal draft with the date it was created by the Champion and its current status. If the criteria are met, a PUSH Champion will edit this post with the exact date the criteria was reached and add a reference to the proposal draft on snapshot once it is created. If the proposal draft doesn’t reach the criteria, a PUSH Champion will also edit the comment saying that it didn’t reach the criteria within 30 days and add the date the proposal draft was closed. Also tag the person who has created the proposal draft on the Governance Proposal.

There are 4 subcategories to this category:

- Started
- Moved to Snapshot
- Proposal Defeated
- Ready to Snapshot

Whenever a new proposal is moved to Governance Discussions, it must go to the Started subcategory. If the proposal didn’t get enough traction or it wasn’t approved on Snapshot, a PUSH Champion will move it to the subcategory Proposal Defeated. If the proposal has gained enough traction and has moved to Snapshot for voting, a PUSH Champion will move to the subcategory called Moved to Snapshot.

Once a proposal draft is moved from Governance Proposals to Governance Discussion, the following can happen:

1. The proposal draft doesn’t get enough traction
2. The proposal draft gets enough traction

### 1 - The proposal draft doesn’t get enough traction

If the proposal draft didn’t get enough traction within 30 days, a PUSH Champion will close the proposal draft and make a comment saying it didn’t meet the criterias. A PUSH Champion will edit the comment made on the proposal draft by one of the champions and will add the information that the proposal draft didn’t meet the criteria within 30 days.

### 2 - The proposal draft gets enough traction

In this case, a PUSH Delegatee will create a proposal on Snapshot.

Once the proposal is moved to Snapshot, add a tag to the proposal draft to highlight that this proposal draft has already been moved to snapshot.

PUSH Champions will check the proposals on snapshot from time to time to verify if there is proposal duplication. Once a new proposal is added to snapshot, the governance champion will add it to the Google Form.

Google Form must be filled out to avoid duplication after the proposal has been created on snapshot.

A proposal will be created in snapshot if the following criteria are met:

- Must be live for 5+ days in the Governance Discussion category
- Proposal on Forum must receive at least 10 likes
- Proposal on Forum must have a minimum of 3 replies

## A proposal is created on Snapshot

All proposals on Snapshot must give at least 7 days for the community to vote on the proposal.

All proposals on snapshot must be created with a link to the Governance Discussion proposal and follow the template.

There are 2 possibilities:

1. The proposal was wrongly created (for example, a proposal is created without a link to the forum proposal)
2. The proposal was created correctly

### 1 - The proposal was wrongly created (for example, a proposal is created without a link to the forum proposal)

In this case, a PUSH Champion will delete the snapshot proposal.

A PUSH Champion will edit the first comment on the proposal draft to indicate to the community that the proposal was deleted since it didn’t follow the template. Explain the reason why the proposal was deleted.

### 2 - The proposal was created correctly

A proposal will be approved if it achieves 4% of the circulating supply of $PUSH voting in the affirmative. If approved or reproved, a PUSH Champion will go back to the Governance Discussion post and comment saying the votes result.

Once the proposal is approved, the team will give high priority to the new feature voted.
