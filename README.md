# PUSH Governance

PUSH is building the world’s first open communication layer for the Web3 ecosystem, first for Ethereum and then for L2s and other blockchains. The protocol enables any smart contracts, dApps or traditional servers to send notifications tied to wallet addresses of a user in a platform agnostic fashion (ie; notifications can be integrated and shown on any crypto wallet, mobile apps, extension or dApps).

- $PUSH contract address: 0xf418588522d5dd018b425E472991E52EBBeEEEEE
- 53% of $PUSH supply is for community allocation
- $PUSH is available through exchanges, liquidity mining and staking initiatives


The PUSH community is fundamental to the network's success. With the Progressive Decentralized Governance infrastructure, we take another step towards greater community participation. For us, it's a thrilling experience. For the community, it's the introduction of the necessary toolkit for discussing and organizing the protocol's future.

PUSH has grown exponentially since the launch of the $PUSH token in April, particularly concerning community engagement. Over 5,400 addresses have already subscribed to PUSH channels, and currently, there are over 3,600 on-chain token holders. Through all of this, decentralization and community empowerment have been the core of our long-term vision.

Following our Token Genesis, we have implemented several community incentivization programs, including liquidity mining and staking initiatives. During this phase, we have also launched the $ROCKSTAR PUSH NFT, while activating the $PUSH rewards mechanism to express gratitude towards our early adopters.
Presently, implementing PUSH Governance marks the protocol's next evolutionary milestone, as we gradually move towards complete decentralization of the decision-making procedure.
 
In this first iteration of the governance mechanism, we will use Snapshot, which is an off-chain and gasless multi-governance client. Due to its Snapshot-based implementation, the voting mechanism shall be weighted based on the number of $PUSH tokens delegated to the voting address.

Hereafter, any potential modifications to the project / protocol / ecosystem must pass through a proposal and voting process. At first, the community will be able to vote and make proposals on the following topics: 

- Grants program
- Weekly Rockstars 
- Meta-Governance
